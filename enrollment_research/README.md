# Enrollment research

This directory publishes the current reverse-engineering findings for native
Touch ID enrollment, identity management, multi-user mapping, Catacomb
persistence, and recovery on Intel Macs with an Apple T2.

- [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) is a sanitized snapshot of the detailed research
  ledger, last updated 2026-08-31.
- [EVIDENCE_COLLECTION.md](EVIDENCE_COLLECTION.md) explains the remaining
  evidence gaps and how to collect data for each one later.
- [`scripts/`](scripts/) contains collection and preflight helpers. They do not
  enroll, delete, load, confirm, or repair biometric state.

The recommended macOS entry point is
[`scripts/collect-all-macos-evidence.sh`](scripts/collect-all-macos-evidence.sh),
which produces one private archive for later offline analysis.

For the narrower selector-42 caller-identity diagnostic, use
[`scripts/collect-aks-caller-identities-macos.sh`](scripts/collect-aks-caller-identities-macos.sh).
It copies only likely Apple system caller executables and their public
code-signing metadata. It does not read a password, keybag, Catacomb, or
fingerprint. Its output is still private research evidence because Apple
binaries must not be committed or redistributed.

The smaller
[`scripts/collect-aks-platform-identities-macos.sh`](scripts/collect-aks-platform-identities-macos.sh)
records the boot-scoped audit-session and process-unique values for currently
running candidate callers. Its output is private and non-replayable; the script
exists to test relationships and field semantics, not to mint credentials.

After transferring an archive privately, inspect a Catacomb component on Linux
without printing its UUIDs:

```sh
enrollment_research/scripts/inspect-catacomb.py path/to/user_000001f5.cat
```

The JSON inventory reports identity labels, counters, creation times, owner UID,
and schema version. UUID output is deliberately opt-in with
`--include-identifiers`; never paste that form into a public issue or log.

## Current boundary

Existing, already-provisioned Apple users appear protocol-feasible for
serialized Linux enrollment and identity management. The host authorization
path, event protocol, per-identity deletion, Catacomb schema, and crash windows
are substantially recovered.

Active development includes two non-mutating foundations: a privacy-safe
offline Catacomb decoder and a live, double-collected SEP inventory that joins
protocol-v2 global and per-user identities plus capacity and Catacomb state. The internal
mutation journal implementation durably syncs append-only, hash-chained intent
and observation records, rejects secret-shaped fields and raw bytes, and fails
closed on tampering or insecure storage. It is not yet connected to any T2
mutation command.

The narrow endpoint-10 research transport has also completed a live tracked
ACM context create/delete lifecycle on the proven machine. The client accepts
only the recovered create and delete frames, binds creation to the configured
macOS UID, redacts the returned context identifier, and attempts deletion even
when response parsing fails. This validates transient context lifecycle only;
it does not authorize enrollment or expose a general ACM command interface.

The following remain disabled or unverified:

- policy authorization and replay behavior for a fresh mode-0 ACM context;
- creation of new AppleKeyStore/OpenDirectory/APFS users from Linux;
- whole-biometric-user removal with command `0x48`;
- writing Linux-generated Catacombs back into macOS; and
- transparent continuation of enrollment across suspend or reconnect.

## Privacy and legal notice

Catacomb files, keybags, account/persona inventories, raw UUIDs, and diagnostic
captures are private security material. The repository intentionally contains
none of them. Collector output is ignored by Git, created with restrictive
permissions, and must be reviewed and sanitized before sharing.

Apple binaries and firmware are not redistributed here. Obtain them from
software installed on hardware you control or from Apple's official restore
and update packages, subject to the terms that apply to you.

This is experimental research, not a supported enrollment implementation. Keep
password login and macOS recovery available, and never test destructive paths
against the only enrolled finger or only usable account.
